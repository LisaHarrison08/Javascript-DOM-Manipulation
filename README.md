# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## (Level 2) Link to search for UFO sightings:
https://ufo-sightings-js.herokuapp.com

## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! This information is now transmitted online for the world to see so the matter can finally be put to rest.

For this challenge, code was written that created a table dynamically based upon a [dataset provided]. Also needed to allow users to be able to filter the table data for specific values. For this project, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js is used for the web pages. 

## Project Overview

### Automatic Table and Date Search

* Created a basic HTML web page.

* Used the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appended to a table in the web page which then added new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Made sure to have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listened for events and searched through the `date/time` column to find rows that matched the user input.

###  Multiple Search Categories

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so the user could set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
